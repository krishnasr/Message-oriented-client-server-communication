on of ports to the communciation between eachother with options

4)Created an extra client in similar fashion for multithreading 

5)Remote procedure call client program logic has been done without using direct packages

6)Later the changes have been made to this rpc client so that it could be suitable for asynchronous and deferred synchronous.


Difficulties faced:

1) Had been clueless while coding for communication options between client and server due to increase errors while trying to debug we could resolve the issue.

2)Got confused between the functionalities of asynchronous and deferred rpcs during its implementation

3)In multithreading adding clients was easy but connecting and synchronise it to a server has been a difficult job for me.

4) Implementation of remote procedure call through code has been a challenging task as well.
